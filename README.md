Hi,

my name is Gian Luca ANFOSSI, I'm a senior Project Engineer (PE) of a International Manufacturing Company that fabricate large scale and complex type heat exchangers and pressure vessel for Chemical and Petro-Chemical Worldwide Companies.

I like programming very much (since 1990 with the classic Basic) and when I can, I create custom software tools to proceed speedy with my daily works when I design and draft a pressure vessels.

Currently I'm specializing in F#, as additional programming language respect to C#.
I like F# very much: more coincise even if for some special and particular issues, C# is better than F#: therefore libraries shall be made in F#, while graphical interfaces shall made in C#.

You can reach me inside GitHub.

Bye!
